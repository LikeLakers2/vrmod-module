Function: number VRMOD_GetVersion()
Description: Returns the module version

Function: boolean VRMOD_IsHMDPresent()
Description: Returns true if a VR headset is connected

Function: VRMOD_Init()
Description: Initializes OpenVR.
This must be called successfully before using the functions listed below.
You must call VRMOD_Shutdown() before calling it again.

Function: VRMOD_SetActionManifest( string fileName )

Function: table VRMOD_GetViewParameters()
Description: Returns the following table of information that can be used to set up
proper 3D rendering
{
  number horizontalFOVLeft,
  number horizontalFOVRight,
  number aspectRatioLeft,
  number aspectRatioRight,
  number recommendedWidth,
  number recommendedHeight,
  vector eyeToHeadTransformPosLeft,
  vector eyeToHeadTransformPosRight,
}

Function: VRMOD_ShareTextureBegin()
Description: After calling this function, the next texture that is created in the game
will be shared with the module. You should create a new texture (using GetRenderTarget
for example) immediately after calling this function. This should be called only once
between init/shutdown.

Function: VRMOD_ShareTextureFinish()
Description: This must be called after creating a texture to finish the texture sharing
process. This should be called only once between init/shutdown.

Function: VRMOD_UpdatePosesAndActions()
Description: This should be called once per frame to update the poses and actions
which you can then use to render with.
This function is also responsible for syncing the fps to the headsets refresh rate.

Function: table VRMOD_GetPoses()
Description: Returns a table of poses. The hmd pose is automatically included, the
rest are defined by the action manifest.
{
  hmd = {
    vector pos,
    vector vel,
    angle ang,
    angle angvel,
  },
  ...
}

Function: table VRMOD_GetActions()
Description: Returns a table of actions (defined by the action manifest) and their states.
It could look something like this:
{
  boolean boolean_example,
  number vector1_example,
  vector2_example = {
    number x,
    number y,
  }
  skeleton_example {
    table fingerCurls = {
      number 1
      number 2
      number 3
      number 4
      number 5
    }
  }
}

Function: VRMOD_SubmitSharedTexture()
Description: Submits the shared texture to the VR Compositor. This should be called

Function: VRMOD_Shutdown()
Description: Shuts down OpenVR and performs some clean up.
You must not call any functions that require it to be active until you call VRMOD_Init()

  number frequency, number amplitude )
Description: Triggers the specified vibration action (defined by the action manifest)
using the given parameters.

# Compiling
#######################################################################################

If you want to compile the module yourself you will need the following:
-OpenVR headers and lib (https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr)
-GMod Lua headers (https://github.com/Facepunch/gmod-module-base/tree/development)
-MinHook headers and lib (https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook)
