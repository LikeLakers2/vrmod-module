This is the module used by the VRMod addon for Garry's Mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678408548).
It adds some basic lua functions for interfacing with OpenVR, and a very crude way to mirror the game window to the VR compositor.

IF YOU JUST WANT TO INSTALL THE MODULE:
Open the distrib folder. Everything you need is in there.
Read the "INSTALLATION.txt" file (also in the distrib folder) for instructions on where to put everything.

If you want to compile the module yourself using visual studio:
-add the source files to your project and make sure the project is configured to produce a .dll
-link openvr_api.lib and get the OpenVR headers, both available at https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr
-get the gmod lua headers https://github.com/Facepunch/gmod-module-base/tree/development
-get MinHook (header and lib, which you can build yourself) https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook

who shared tips and their proof of concept gmod vr module source on the VRMod Workshop Discussions,
on which the current directx hooking and texture sharing method is very heavily based on.
