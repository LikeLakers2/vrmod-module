This is the module used by the VRMod addon for Garry's Mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678408548).
It adds some basic lua functions for interfacing with OpenVR, and a way to mirror a texture from the game to the VR compositor.

If you want to compile the module yourself using visual studio:
-add the source files to your project and make sure the project is configured to produce a .dll
-link openvr_api.lib and get the OpenVR headers, both available at https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr
-get the gmod lua headers https://github.com/Facepunch/gmod-module-base/tree/development
-get MinHook (header and lib, which you can build yourself) https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook
