This is the module used by the VRMod addon for Garry's Mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678408548).
It adds some basic lua functions for interfacing with OpenVR, and a very crude way to mirror the game window to the VR compositor.

To compile with visual studio: add the source files to your project and make sure the project is configured to produce a .dll
you also need to link openvr_api.lib and include the OpenVR headers, available at https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr
