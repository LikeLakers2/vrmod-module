This is the module used by the VRMod addon for Garry's Mod (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1678408548).
It adds some basic lua functions for interfacing with OpenVR, and a very crude way to mirror the game window to the VR compositor.

If you just want to use the module with VRMod, download the repo as .zip from the button on the top right.
The relevant files are in the distrib folder. Read "INSTALLATION.txt" for instructions on where to put everything.

To compile with visual studio: add the source files to your project and make sure the project is configured to produce a .dll
you'll also need to:
-link openvr_api.lib and get the OpenVR headers, both available at https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr
-get the gmod lua headers https://github.com/Facepunch/gmod-module-base/tree/development
-get the OpenGL extension headers GL/glext.h, GL/wglext.h, KHR/khrplatform.h https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/index_gl.php
