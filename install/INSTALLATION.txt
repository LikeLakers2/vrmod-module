Go to the folder where you have gmod and other steam games installed (such as C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common)
drag the GarrysMod folder that is next to this INSTALLATION.txt into that "common" folder.
It should merge with the existing GarrysMod folder and the files will automatically go into the right places.
